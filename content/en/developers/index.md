Do you want to learn more about 3DBAG?

Join us on 28 May 2025 for the second 3DBAG Developers Meeting – a free event for anyone using (or curious about) the 3DBAG software!

Whether you're already a user or just getting started, this is a great chance to:

- Discover the latest developments from [3D GeoInformation Group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) and [3DGI](https://3dgi.nl/)

- Learn how to generate building models in CityJSON through hands-on tutorials

- Hear from users who’ve applied 3DBAG to their own data and projects

The session is funded by the 3DBAG Innovation Platform and [Geonovum](https://www.geonovum.nl/).
If you're interested in 3D geodata, open-source tools, or want to contribute to the 3DBAG project yourself, we'd love to see you there!
